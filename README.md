# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS

This project is built with Vite, Vue.js 3, and TailwindCSS and is intended as a learning project. Vite provides a modern development experience with fast builds and instant hot module replacement. Vue.js is a popular progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces, and TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-defined CSS classes to help you quickly build custom designs. Together, these frameworks offer a great opportunity to learn modern web development techniques.
